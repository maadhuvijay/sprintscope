# SprintScope project definition (2026-01-20 02:41Z)

_**User (2026-01-20 02:41Z)**_

You are helping me build a project called “SprintScope” using next.js, react

SprintScope is a chat-based query application that allows users to ask questions about sprint / Agile data in natural language, without needing to know SQL or database schemas. The system translates user questions into SQL queries using an LLM, executes them against a database, and returns real results in a readable way.

This project is focused on:
- Natural language → SQL translation
- Tool calling
- Query execution, result display, and query correction
- Handling ambiguous user requests via clarification instead of guessing

TARGET STACK

- Frontend & Backend: Next.js (App Router)
- Deployment: Vercel
- Database: Supabase (Postgres). I will connect to supabase later
- LLM: Claude (Anthropic), model: **Claude Sonnet 4.5**

HIGH-LEVEL BEHAVIOR

1. User types a question about sprint data in a chat UI and clicks “Run Query”.
2. The application sends the request to Claude.
3. Claude uses custom tools to:
   - Understand the database schema
   - Generate SQL
   - Execute the SQL
   - Repair the SQL if execution fails
   - Explain the results in plain English
4. The UI displays:
   - A conversational explanation of the results
   - Access to the executed SQL and execution details (via an inspector-style panel)

The attached screenshot roughly covers the intended design

For now, do not proceed to code anything. simply confirm your understanding of the task. I will iteratively instruct you on the pieces that we will be building

## Project Overview
**SprintScope** — A chat-based natural language query system for sprint/Agile data that translates questions to SQL and returns results.

## Core Features
1. Natural language → SQL translation via LLM
2. Tool calling for schema understanding, SQL generation, execution, and repair
3. Query correction when execution fails
4. Clarification for ambiguous requests (no guessing)

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) for frontend and backend
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) — connection later
- **LLM**: Claude (Anthropic), model: Claude Sonnet 4.5

## User Flow
1. User enters a question in the chat UI and clicks "Run Query"
2. Request sent to Claude
3. Claude uses tools to:
   - Understand the database schema
   - Generate SQL
   - Execute SQL
   - Repair SQL on failure
   - Explain results in plain English
4. UI displays:
   - Conversational explanation
   - Executed SQL and execution details (inspector panel)

Ready for your next instructions.
