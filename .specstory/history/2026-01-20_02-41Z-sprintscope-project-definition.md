# SprintScope project definition (2026-01-20 02:41Z)

_**User (2026-01-20 02:41Z)**_

You are helping me build a project called “SprintScope” using next.js, react

SprintScope is a chat-based query application that allows users to ask questions about sprint / Agile data in natural language, without needing to know SQL or database schemas. The system translates user questions into SQL queries using an LLM, executes them against a database, and returns real results in a readable way.

This project is focused on:
- Natural language → SQL translation
- Tool calling
- Query execution, result display, and query correction
- Handling ambiguous user requests via clarification instead of guessing

TARGET STACK

- Frontend & Backend: Next.js (App Router)
- Deployment: Vercel
- Database: Supabase (Postgres). I will connect to supabase later
- LLM: Claude (Anthropic), model: **Claude Sonnet 4.5**

HIGH-LEVEL BEHAVIOR

1. User types a question about sprint data in a chat UI and clicks “Run Query”.
2. The application sends the request to Claude.
3. Claude uses custom tools to:
   - Understand the database schema
   - Generate SQL
   - Execute the SQL
   - Repair the SQL if execution fails
   - Explain the results in plain English
4. The UI displays:
   - A conversational explanation of the results
   - Access to the executed SQL and execution details (via an inspector-style panel)

The attached screenshot roughly covers the intended design

For now, do not proceed to code anything. simply confirm your understanding of the task. I will iteratively instruct you on the pieces that we will be building

Next we are going to build the front end interface with a modern futuristic neon aesthetic on a dark background. Build a single page with a fixed header, a two-column workspace, and a fixed bottom composer. Use clean typography, high contrast, subtle glassmorphism, and neon accent borders. The UI should feel like an AI developer console.

Refer to the images attached for the design. Do not create tools or llm powered responses yet. For now just create a functionality that responds with gibberish as the user sends message and clicks ‘Run Query’

GOAL
Build a dark, modern, futuristic “AI console” interface with neon accents and glassmorphism. The page has:
- Left: Chat Console (user message + assistant explanation + follow-up suggestions)
- Right: Model Trace panel with tabs (SQL / Results), a code viewer with Copy button, and collapsible sections for Assumptions and Execution
- Bottom: composer bar with input + Reset Session + Run Query button

VISUAL IDENTITY / COLOR SCHEME
- Overall background: deep space / nebula vibe with subtle starfield/dot noise. Use a dark indigo-to-purple gradient with faint speckles.
  - Base background gradient: #050816 → #0B0F2A → #140A2A
  - Add subtle noise texture and tiny star-like dots at very low opacity.
- Outer container: rounded rectangle with a thin neon border + soft glow.
  - Corner radius: 18–24px
  - Border: 1px solid rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.35)
  - Outer glow: rgba(236, 72, 153, 0.20) + rgba(34, 211, 238, 0.12)
- Panels/cards: translucent “glass” surfaces with blur.
  - Panel bg: rgba(20, 24, 50, 0.55)
  - Card bg: rgba(17, 24, 39, 0.55)
  - Backdrop blur: 12–18px
  - Border: 1px solid rgba(99, 102, 241, 0.22)
  - Shadow: soft, wide, low-contrast (avoid harsh shadows)
- Primary accents:
  - Cyan/teal highlight: #22D3EE (used for user message glow + small bullets)
  - Purple/violet: #8B5CF6 (headers, active borders)
  - Magenta/pink: #EC4899 (subtle glow edges + keyword highlights)
  - Amber: #F59E0B (execution emphasis)
- Typography:
  - Headings: semi-bold, clean sans (white with slight violet tint)
  - Body: high readability, off-white #E5E7EB / #F3F4F6
  - Code: monospace with neon syntax highlighting
- Syntax highlighting palette (approx):
  - Keywords (select, from, join, where, order by, limit): violet/pink
  - Identifiers/columns: off-white
  - Strings: warm amber
  - Operators/punctuation: muted gray-blue

LAYOUT (MATCH THE IMAGE)
TOP BAR
- Left: “SprintScope” title
- Top-right within the frame: a Help (?) icon.

MAIN GRID
- Two columns inside the rounded frame:
  LEFT (≈60–65% width): “Chat Console”
   - Large user message card at top with cyan glow edge and user prompt text.
   - Assistant message card below with a longer plain-English summary of results.
   - Include a small “If you’d like, I can:” section with 3 bullet suggestions.
   - Bullets are small cyan dots.
  RIGHT (≈35–40% width): “Model Trace”
   - Title “Model Trace”
   - Two pill tabs near top: “SQL”,and “Results”
##SQL tab
-SQL tab becomes active when selected
 - Large code viewer panel occupying most of the space, with:
 - “Copy” button at top-right inside the code viewer
when SQL tab is selected
     - SQL code with syntax highlighting and line spacing similar to the image
-Safety Check
SELECT-only
LIMIT applied

##Results 
-Results tab becomes active when selected
 -Displays full query results in a table.
   - Sticky column headers.
   - Pagination controls at bottom.
   - Actions: “Export CSV” (neon underline links).
   - Highlight primary key / issue key column with accent color.
  
 Below code viewer: two collapsed accordion rows:
 ##“Assumptions” row (chevron + right-side arrow indicator)

   - Bullet list of model interpretations.
   - Each assumption shown as a pill or subtle callout.
   - Purple accent for inferred logic.

##Execution
     - “Execution” row (amber emphasis + chevron + right-side arrow)
Execution metadata in key-value format:
     - Status (success/failure)
     - Rows returned
     - Runtime (ms)
     - Database (e.g., Supabase Postgres)
   - Use amber accent for runtime and warnings.
   - If errors occurred, show error message in a muted red panel.
   

BOTTOM COMPOSER BAR (FULL WIDTH INSIDE FRAME)
- Left: large rounded input field with placeholder “Ask a question about your sprint data…”
- Right side actions:
  - “Reset Session” as a subtle link/text
  - “Run Query” as the primary CTA button with neon gradient glow
    - Button gradient: violet → cyan, with soft outer glow
    - Rounded corners ~12px
    - Slight hover glow increase

COMPONENT DETAILS
- Use consistent 12–16px radii for inner cards, 18–24px for outer shell.
- Spacing: generous padding (20–28px outer, 16–20px inner).
- Dividers: ultra subtle 1px lines (rgba(255,255,255,0.06)).
- Animations: very subtle (hover glow, tab underline/pill glow, accordion chevrons).

MICROCOPY (MATCH TONE)
- Keep copy concise and professional, similar to the image.
- Assistant text should read like a factual summary of SQL results (no speculation).
- Include “key text” highlighted in magenta/purple within assistant text.

DELIVERABLE
- Produce a single UI page that visually matches the reference image as closely as possible.
- Preserve the same information architecture and visual hierarchy.
- Ensure the design is responsive, but prioritize desktop layout fidelity.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
**Imagining the Interface**

I'm currently picturing the user interface. Neon lights, right? How to best leverage Tailwind for that futuristic aesthetic in Next.js's App Router? Thinking about component structure and optimal rendering strategies to keep performance snappy, despite the visual complexity.


**Conceptualizing the Build**

The architectural vision is forming. I'm prioritizing component reusability. App Router routes will handle data fetching and initial rendering. I'm focusing on the visual hierarchy to make sure the user flow makes sense. How to use Tailwind's `glass` utilities properly? I'm thinking of where state management belongs, maybe Context API for the main app, with Recoil for fine-grained state.


**Mapping the Structure**

The project skeleton is becoming clear. I'm focusing on the component breakdown now. I'm starting with a `Layout` component to handle the global styling and the page's overall structure, including rounded corners and neon borders. Then, I'll tackle the `ChatConsole` and `ModelTrace` components, splitting each into its sub-components, such as user and assistant message cards, tabbed views, accordions, and the input/button at the bottom. The plan is to create them from scratch using Tailwind rather than Shadcn.


**Planning the Components**

My current focus is breaking down the components to match the "SprintScope" requirements. I'm finalizing the structure of the `Layout`, `ChatConsole`, and `ModelTrace`. Deciding whether to lean on Shadcn/UI for some elements, or build them from scratch with Tailwind. I'm leaning toward the latter to maintain full control over the aesthetic. I need to make a component breakdown to see how they will all be connected. Also, the choice of a specific color gradient needs to be made for the 'Run Query' button.

**Installing Initial Dependencies**

I've just finished the initial dependency installations: `lucide-react` and `framer-motion` are in place. Now I'm moving on to setting up the basic styling, specifically focusing on the background and neon effect. Tailwind CSS v4 will be used for all styling. Next will be component creation.


**Analyzing Style and Structure**

I'm now shifting my focus to `globals.css` to prep the background and neon effects as per the original plan. My next move is setting up those crucial UI components, following that style foundation. I'll need to make sure Tailwind is integrated properly.

**Creating the UI Framework**

I'm currently focused on the UI framework, and have begun by establishing a `components` directory. My next step is to build the main page structure in `app/page.tsx`. I've outlined the components I intend to build: `Header.tsx`, `ChatConsole.tsx`, and `ModelTrace.tsx`.


**Constructing UI Components**

I'm now diving into the component creation process. The `components` directory is ready, and I'm transitioning to crafting the main page structure within `app/page.tsx`. I've added `Composer.tsx` to the list. I'm prioritizing the creation of a utility for class merging before commencing on components.

**Reviewing the Implementation**

I'm revisiting the `lib/utils.ts` file, making sure I haven't missed anything. I've already done most of the work, so it should be a quick check. Now I'm shifting focus to building the initial components, and I'll start with a single-page approach in `app/page.tsx`.


**Considering the Next Steps**

Now, I've confirmed that `lib/utils.ts` is fine and doesn't need changes. Moving on, I'm already planning to break down the `app/page.tsx` file into components to manage the complexity. My next step will be to create the `components/Header.tsx` file to start.

**Structuring the Interface**

I'm currently focused on the structure of `components/ModelTrace.tsx`. I've outlined tabs for SQL and Results views. The plan also incorporates the code viewer, with collapsible sections dedicated to Assumptions and Execution details.

**Developing the UI's Core**

I've finished the core UI implementation. I installed dependencies like `lucide-react` and `framer-motion`. I also integrated `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`. I've implemented global styles with a "deep space" background, including a starfield effect and glassmorphism.


**Concluding the UI Build**

I'm wrapping up the UI. The core components are done and integrated: a styled header, the chat console with custom borders, the model trace panel with code highlighting, and the composer bar. I've integrated basic query handling and a placeholder AI response. Next, I'll update my task list to reflect the completed work.

**Confirming the understanding**

I'm checking the server status, a standard procedure, although the user hasn't specified it. Reviewing the last turn, I see the instructions were to confirm my grasp of the task. That's a different direction entirely. I need to recalibrate, refocus on my understanding, and less on server admin.


**Reassessing the Requirements**

My understanding now centers on the user's intent. The focus is to produce a UI page matching a reference image. I've built the page, considering the image. The user's "confirm your understanding" question was a diversion. Now, I will provide a summary of the page and request feedback.

I have built the **SprintScope** frontend interface with the requested futuristic neon aesthetic.

### Key Implementation Details:

*   **Visual Identity**: 
    *   **Background**: A deep space nebula gradient (`#050816` → `#140A2A`) with a subtle starfield effect.
    *   **Glassmorphism**: Panels and cards use `backdrop-blur` (12px–18px) and semi-translucent backgrounds (`rgba(20, 24, 50, 0.55)`).
    *   **Neon Accents**: Cyan borders for user messages, Purple for the assistant, and a Neon Gradient (Violet → Cyan) for the "Run Query" button.
*   **Layout**:
    *   **Left (Chat Console)**: Displays the conversation. User messages have a cyan glow edge. Assistant responses include a "If you'd like, I can:" section with bullet suggestions and keyword highlighting in magenta.
    *   **Right (Model Trace)**:
        *   **SQL Tab**: Features a dark code viewer with syntax highlighting (SELECT-only and LIMIT indicators).
        *   **Results Tab**: A data table with sticky headers, neon-accented primary keys, and "Export CSV" link.
        *   **Collapsible Sections**: "Assumptions" (Purple) and "Execution" (Amber) with detailed metadata like runtime and row counts.
    *   **Bottom (Composer)**: A floating input bar with a "Reset Session" link and the primary "Run Query" button.
*   **Functionality**:
    *   Clicking **"Run Query"** adds your message to the console and triggers a simulated "AI thinking" state.
    *   The assistant responds after a short delay with a combination of contextual "gibberish" and randomized metrics.
    *   **"Reset Session"** clears the chat history back to the initial welcome state.

### Tech Stack Used:
*   **Tailwind CSS 4**: For the neon effects, gradients, and layout.
*   **Framer Motion**: For smooth transitions in the chat and collapsible accordions.
*   **Lucide React**: For the futuristic icon set.

You can now test the interface by typing a question and clicking "Run Query". Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to the styling or layout!

_**User (2026-01-20 02:41Z)**_

On first load, the assistant should: Show 3 example questions the user can immediately try like
• What issues are blocked in the current sprint?
• How many stories were completed last sprint?
• Which assignees have the most open issues?
• Show bugs created in the last two weeks
• What work is still in progress for Team ACCEL?

once the first message is sent, sprintscope can ask questions based on the query like
• Break this down by team
• Compare with previous sprint
• Export this view

I've updated the **Chat Console** to handle the dynamic suggestions as requested:

1.  **First Load / Initial State**:
    *   The assistant now displays the specific set of starter questions:
        *   *What issues are blocked in the current sprint?*
        *   *How many stories were completed last sprint?*
        *   *Which assignees have the most open issues?*
        *   *Show bugs created in the last two weeks*
        *   *What work is still in progress for Team ACCEL?*
2.  **Post-Query State**:
    *   Once you send a message or click a suggestion, the assistant switches its follow-up suggestions to:
        *   *Break this down by team*
        *   *Compare with previous sprint*
        *   *Export this view*
3.  **Interactive Suggestions**: 
    *   I've made the suggestions clickable. Clicking any suggestion will automatically "Run Query" with that text, making it easy to explore the interface.

The "Reset Session" button also correctly restores the initial starter questions. Ready to proceed with your next instructions!
